  
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Daniel, and I am an aspiring web developer with a passion for artificial intelligence.
  I am at the beginning of my web development journey, dedicated to learning and full of dreams.</p>

<p>I graduated in Chemical Engineering, and my passion for programming began in the final years of college during
 the Process Modeling and Simulation course. I excelled in this subject and became a teaching assistant in subsequent semesters.
 After dedicating some time to a family business project, I finally found the time to learn new languages such as HTML, CSS, and
 JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML & CSS: Basic knowledge in structuring and styling web pages. I have created simple, responsive layouts as part of my studies.</li>
  <li>JavaScript: Development of dynamic functionalities. I have developed small scripts for interactivity on web pages.</li>
  <li>Advanced Excel: Proficiency in VBA, macros, and Power Query, skills that I apply to automate tasks and analyze data efficiently.
  Goals</li>
</ul>

<p>My goal is to continue improving my web development skills, focusing initially on front-end and then expanding to back-end.
   I aim to get exposure to new programming languages, apply what I have learned in real projects, and learn in a team environment.</p>
